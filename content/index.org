I am a 1st-year Master's student at the [[https://www.utoronto.ca/][University of Toronto]], where I am advised by [[https://xnning.github.io/][Ningning Xie]].

My main interest is Programming Languages. Currently with a focus on Algebraic Effects and Effect Handlers.

I am also broadly interested in Mathematics. I am finding the time to learn Category Theory, Logic, and Topology.
